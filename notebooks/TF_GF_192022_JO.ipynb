        "it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
        "\n",
        "To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or\n",
        "asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if\n",
        "you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\n",
        "you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make\n",

        "applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\n",

        "making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n",
        "parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n",
        "network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n",

        "\n",
        "The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n",
        "making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a\n",

        "Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\n",

        "generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those\n",
        "activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\n",
        "includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n",
        "the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work\n",

        "\n",
        "All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the\n",
        "Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License\n",
        "explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The\n",
        "output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,\n",
        "given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights\n",
        "of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\n",
        "conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered\n",
        "works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively\n",
        "for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you\n",
        "comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\n",
        "control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so\n",
        "exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit\n",
        "them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship\n",
        "with you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\n",
        "stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n",
        "\n",
        "No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any\n",
        "applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty\n",
        "adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\n",
        "of such measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of\n",
        "technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\n",
        "rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any\n",
        "intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\n",
        "against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\n",
        "of technological measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n",
        "\n",
        "You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\n",
        "medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n",
        "appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and\n",
        "any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\n",
        "intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of\n",
        "this License along with the Program.\n",
        "\n",

        "support or warranty protection for a fee.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n",
        "\n",
        "You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\n",
        "the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that\n",
        "you also meet all of these conditions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a\n",
        "relevant date.\n",
        "* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this\n",
        "License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the\n",
        "requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n",
        "* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\n",
        "comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\n",
        "applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n",
        "regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the\n",
        "work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n",
        "separately received it.\n",
        "* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal\n",
        "Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display\n",
        "Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are\n",
        "not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with\n",
        "it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\n",
        "medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting\n",
        "copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n",
        "beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\n",
        "does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n",
        "\n",
        "You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and\n",
        "5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the\n",

        "\n",
        "* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n",
        "physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a\n",
        "durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n",
        "* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n",
        "physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least\n",
        "three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for\n",

        "source, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\n",
        "charge.\n",
        "* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to\n",
        "provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and\n",
        "noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in\n",
        "accord with subsection 6b.\n",
        "* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for\n",
        "a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way\n",
        "through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy\n",
        "the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object\n",
        "code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server\n",
        "(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,\n",

        "you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy\n",
        "these requirements.\n",
        "* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\n",
        "other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\n",
        "offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n",
